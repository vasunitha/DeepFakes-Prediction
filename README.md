# DeepFakes Prediction
 The goal of the research is to employ data  augmentation methods and convolutional neural networks  (CNNs) to create a high-precision deepfake detection model.  The model is trained, validated, and tested with great care and  attention to detail, utilising a mixed dataset of genuine and fake  photos that are obtained from Kaggle. The architecture of the  model is optimised for best results using hyperparameter  optimisation, which also makes use of Random Search. With a  test accuracy of roughly 53%, the final model demonstrates its  capacity to discriminate between authentic and fraudulent  photos. Despite this achievement, there are still areas that might  be improved. For example, to increase deepfake detection  systems' accuracy, generalisation, and robustness, more  regularisation approaches should be investigated, transfer  learning should be used, and ensemble learning should be  embraced.
